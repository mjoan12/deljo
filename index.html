    <h2 class="text-white uppercase text-center text-4xl pb-20">resume</h2>
    <h5 class="text-white   text-1xl px-20 pb-20">In the July of 1982, Masoud Deljou was born in Rasht, a northern city of Gilan province in Iran.<br> He started playing instruments when he was 18 with Cittern/Cithern (a traditional three-stringed Persian instrument), but after one year he started to play Electric Guitar.<br> Artists like Roger Waters, Björk, Jeff Buckley and Rock bands like Nirvana, Radiohead and Sigur Ros were so influential to his music taste. Also the legendary Rock guitarist Jeff Beck's playing whether in term of sound or the experimentalism that Beck had in his approach during different periods of time, was so inspiring for Masoud.<br>
        The music genres that Masoud Deljou (M.D.) has worked in includes Rock, Alternative Rock, Blues, Jazz and also some projects and experiences in electronic music recently. Especially the combination of Asian folk music's sounds and western music's rhythms and harmonies. <br>
        Masoud has started making music since 2007 and his bands and solo musical activities can be listed as follows:<br>
        <br>
        ✓ In 2007 Masoud and some of his friends, for the first time in their city Rasht, created a Jazz ensemble and then recorded and released a Jazz album titled "Caspian Jazz" with some other musicians of Rasht, <br>
        <br>
        ✓ Few years later he founded the alternative rock band Moonhead (M.D. as vocalist, guitarist, lyricist, main composer and arranger). Their debut album called "The Event Horizon" (2015) was nominated for the "Best Album with Persian Lyrics of the Year" in "Barbad Awards 2016" (an international music festival in Iran). Moonhead have also played many concerts and live performances in various places and cities. <br>
        In addition, Moonhead's second album is about to be ready and will be released after finishing mix and master process.<br>
        <br>
        ✓ During Masoud's musical activities, he composed original soundtracks for two movies as well as musics for several video documentaries about Gilan province, Caspian Sea, Gilak people and Talesh people.  <br>
        Furthermore composing and playing musics for some plays and theatre live shows in Rasht including: <br>
        - "The Maids" (of Jean Genet)<br>
        - "The Man with the Flower in his Mouth" (of Luigi Pirandello)<br>
        - "The Venetian Gang" (of Carlo Goldoni)<br>
        - "A Man is A Man" (of Bertolt Brecht)<br>
        <br>
        ✓ After COVID-19 pandemic, Masoud started "Nakook" electronic project which mostly focuses on making podcasts, mixes and remixes and currently he's making a musical podcast for National Radio of Finland. <br>
        By the way M.D. is one of the co-founders of Hyrcany local radio which is involved in recording, producing programs and broadcasting the albums of all musical productions in the geographical territory of Hyrcany ancient forests in the north of Iran. <br>
        <br>
        ✓ Although Masoud's main instrument is electric guitar, in recent years he's been involved in composing and arranging music, such as the songs that he's made for the poems of Persian poet "Shams Langaroudi" according to Shams' request. 
        <br>
        ✓ It's about 2 decades that Masoud Deljou has worked in the field of music teaching (guitar playing, composing, music theory, recording, etc.) and as an appreciation to these years of musical activities, he has received a special badge of art from the former mayor of Rasht. <br>
        In recent years, he has also launched and runs a weekly gathering in Rasht called "Jam Session" which is a place for the local young musicians to have an opportunity to grow and develop their talents by playing instruments and introducing their works.</h5>
